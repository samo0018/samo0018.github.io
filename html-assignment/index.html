        <h2>About</h2>

         <p>
             
             Before becoming a student at Algonquin College, I completed my undergraduate education at <abbr title="University of Victoria">UVic</abbr>, where I got my BA in psychology. 
             I am excited to take this program because I hope to use my learned practical skills to work as a UX/UI designer. 
             I hope that by taking this program, the co-op work term will help me get my footing in a specialized work environment so I can land a job before I graduate and succeed in my career.

         <p>

             As far as my personal hobbies go, I enjoy paddleboarding, cycling, running and making digital art. I love animals and being outdoors makes me happy. 
             In my childhood, I used to travel a lot with my family and have been all over the world, from Tel-Aviv to Hong Kong. 
             To this day, I truly enjoy traveling and find that I can't sit in one place for too long. Fall is my favourite season and <em> The Office </em> is one of my favourite shows.
